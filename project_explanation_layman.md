# Project Explanation: AI Social Media Assistant for Doctors

## What is this project?

Imagine a helpful assistant who reads the latest news every day and then writes interesting social media posts for your doctor. This project is exactly thatâ€”an automated social media assistant designed specifically for healthcare professionals. It helps doctors stay active on social media by providing them with fresh, relevant content to share with their audience.

## How does it work? (Data Flow)

The process is simple and can be broken down into a few key steps:

1.  **Picks a Topic:** The assistant starts by choosing a news category from a list of topics like "Health," "Science," or "Environment."

2.  **Reads the News:** Once a topic is selected, the assistant visits a reputable news website and reads the latest articles in that category.

3.  **Writes a Post:** After reading an article, the assistant uses artificial intelligence (the same technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT) to write a short and engaging social media post. The post is designed to be interesting for a medical audience and often includes emojis and hashtags to make it more appealing.

4.  **Delivers the Post:** The final post is then delivered and ready to be shared on the doctor's social media accounts.

## The "Architecture" (How it's built)

Think of the project as having two main parts that work together:

1.  **The "Brain" (`main.py`):** This is the core of the operation. It's responsible for all the smart work, like picking the news, reading the articles (using a service called Firecrawl), and writing the posts (using Google's Gemini AI).

2.  **The "Messenger" (`api_server.py`):** This part of the project acts like a messenger. It takes the post created by the "Brain" and makes it available through a simple web link (an API). This allows other applications or services to easily grab the post and share it.

In short, this project is a time-saving tool that helps doctors maintain an active and informative social media presence with minimal effort.
